	* Variables
		Variables are containers for differing types of data, whether it is a number, string, array, or boolean value.
	* Strings
		Strings are textual-based data. They hold no value that can be manipulated like numbers can. Though they can hold alphanumerical information. What you see is what you get with strings.
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
		Functions are sub-programs that can be provided with an input (argument) and will provide an output (return) based on its internal code. Think like a black box.
	* `if` statements
		If statements are used as a way for code to repeat itself. They typically start with a provided condition and will end when its code has been completed.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
		Boolean values are binary conditions. When a value is boolean, it must be either 'true' or 'false'. There are no other boolean values available.
